## Why
We need a clear, spec-driven plan to implement an SMS spam classification workflow and a Streamlit app for live inference, aligned with the course HW3 requirements.

## What Changes
- Add data preprocessing pipeline to clean and persist a prepared dataset
- Add model training/evaluation using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
- Add analysis/visualization notebook that runs end-to-end with Traditional Chinese explanations
- Add Streamlit app for interactive spam detection with dashboards and live inference
- Add final OpenSpec-based report documentation

## Impact
- Affected specs: `specs/spam-classifier/spec.md`
- Affected code: `preprocessing.py`, `train.py`, `predict.py`, `app.py`, `HW3.ipynb`
