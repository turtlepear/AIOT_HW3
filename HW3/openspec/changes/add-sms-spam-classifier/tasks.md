## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Create `preprocessing.py` to load, clean, encode, and save dataset
- [ ] 1.2 Create `train.py` to split data, train TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, evaluate, and save model
- [ ] 1.3 Create `predict.py` to load model/vectorizer and predict new samples
- [ ] 1.4 Create `HW3.ipynb` notebook integrating preprocessing → training → prediction with Traditional Chinese markdown before each code cell; execute successfully
- [ ] 1.5 Create `app.py` Streamlit app with sidebar params, dashboards (overview, top tokens, metrics, ROC/PR, threshold sweep), and live inference UI

## 2. Validation & QA
- [ ] 2.1 Run end-to-end on `sms_spam_no_header.csv`, confirm saved cleaned dataset and model outputs
- [ ] 2.2 Verify metrics and visualizations appear in notebook and app
- [ ] 2.3 Manual tests for live inference (spam/ham examples and custom input)

## 3. Documentation
- [ ] 3.1 Write final OpenSpec-based report summarizing phases and outcomes
- [ ] 3.2 Update README instructions to run preprocessing, training, notebook, and app
